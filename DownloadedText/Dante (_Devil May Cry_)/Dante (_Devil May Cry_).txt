**Dante** (ダンテ[?](/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets "Help:Installing Japanese character sets" )) is a fictional character and the primary [protagonist](/wiki/Protagonist "Protagonist" ) of the _[Devil May Cry](/wiki/Devil_May_Cry "Devil May Cry" )_ series created and published by [Capcom](/wiki/Capcom "Capcom" ).[3] In the first four games, Dante is a [mercenary](/wiki/Mercenary "Mercenary" ), [private investigator](/wiki/Private_investigator "Private investigator" ), and [demon](/wiki/Demon "Demon" ) hunting [vigilante](/wiki/Vigilante "Vigilante" ) dedicated to exterminating them and other malevolent supernatural foes, a mission he follows in pursuit of those that killed his mother and corrupted his brother. He is the son of [Sparda](/wiki/Sparda "Sparda" ), a demon of great power and as a result of his heritage, he possesses numerous powers [beyond that of any human](/wiki/Superhuman "Superhuman" ), which he uses in combination with a variety of weapons to accomplish his goals. The character also appears in several [_Devil May Cry_ novels](/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_\(novels\) "Devil May Cry \(novels\)" ) and [manga](/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_3_\(manga\) "Devil May Cry 3 \(manga\)" ) volumes; and is featured in the [2007 anime television series](/wiki/Devil_May_Cry:_The_Animated_Series "Devil May Cry: The Animated Series" ). A [reboot](/wiki/Reboot_\(fiction\) "Reboot \(fiction\)" ) of the series by [Ninja Theory](/wiki/Ninja_Theory "Ninja Theory" ) features him in an alternate universe as a young adult fighting against demons. Dante has also appeared as a guest character in multiple crossover games.

Named after the Italian poet [Dante Alighieri](/wiki/Dante_Alighieri "Dante
Alighieri" ), the character was designed to fit _Devil May Cry_ game designer
[Hideki Kamiya](/wiki/Hideki_Kamiya "Hideki Kamiya" )'s vision of a "cool and
stylish" man, and his personality was based on the title character of the
manga series _[Cobra](/wiki/Cobra_\(manga\) "Cobra \(manga\)" )_. Across the
series, Dante's portrayal has been modified to appeal to criticism aimed
towards his role in the [first sequel](/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_2 "Devil May Cry 2"
) with _Devil May Cry 3_ featuring a younger and cockier Dante while _Devil
May Cry 4_ offered an older yet cocky characterization. While Capcom handled
the character in the first four games, Ninja Theory was in charge of his
persona in the reboot.

Dante has become one of the most popular characters in gaming, having been
recognized for his role in the _Devil May Cry_ series and various
characteristics that have attracted gamers. However, Dante's redesign and
characterization in the reboot was the subject of controversy amongst gamers.
