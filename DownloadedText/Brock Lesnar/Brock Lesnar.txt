Following his match with [Goldberg](/wiki/Bill_Goldberg "Bill Goldberg" ) at

He was named a [defensive tackle](/wiki/Defensive_tackle "Defensive tackle" )

returned to professional wrestling and signed with [New Japan Pro-

In 2006, Lesnar pursued a career in mixed martial arts (MMA), as he signed
with [Hero's](/wiki/Hero%27s "Hero's" ) and won his first fight, against [Min-
Soo Kim](/wiki/Kim_Min-soo_\(judoka\) "Kim Min-soo \(judoka\)" ), in June
2007.[12] He then signed with the [Ultimate Fighting

against [Frank Mir](/wiki/Frank_Mir "Frank Mir" ) and then won his second
fight against [Heath Herring](/wiki/Heath_Herring "Heath Herring" ). In
November 2008, Lesnar defeated [Randy Couture](/wiki/Randy_Couture "Randy

title defense in a rematch with Mir, Lesnar was sidelined due to
[diverticulitis](/wiki/Diverticulitis "Diverticulitis" ). He would return at
_[UFC 116](/wiki/UFC_116 "UFC 116" )_ to defeat Interim UFC Heavyweight

Lesnar then lost the championship to [Cain Velasquez](/wiki/Cain_Velasquez

once again sidelined due to diverticulitis and underwent surgery.[13] Lesnar
returned at _[UFC 141](/wiki/UFC_141 "UFC 141" )_ in December, losing to

In April 2012, Lesnar once again returned to professional wrestling, rejoining
WWE after an eight-year hiatus. Two years later, at [WrestleMania
XXX](/wiki/WrestleMania_XXX "WrestleMania XXX" ), Lesnar defeated [The
Undertaker](/wiki/The_Undertaker "The Undertaker" ) to end his [undefeated
streak](/wiki/The_Streak_\(wrestling\) "The Streak \(wrestling\)" ) at
[WrestleMania](/wiki/WrestleMania "WrestleMania" ). He achieved [world
champion](/wiki/Professional_wrestling_championship#World_championships
"Professional wrestling championship" ) status twice since his return, having
won the then WWE World Heavyweight Championship in 2014 and the WWE Universal
Championship in 2017. Lesnar has been
[managed](/wiki/Manager_\(professional_wrestling\) "Manager \(professional
wrestling\)" ) by [Paul Heyman](/wiki/Paul_Heyman "Paul Heyman" ) throughout
the majority of his professional wrestling career.

In June 2016 at _[UFC 199](/wiki/UFC_199 "UFC 199" )_, the UFC announced that
Lesnar would return to MMA to fight at _[UFC 200](/wiki/UFC_200 "UFC 200" )_.
His opponent was later revealed to be [Mark Hunt](/wiki/Mark_Hunt "Mark Hunt"
). Lesnar would defeat Hunt via unanimous decision. However, after Lesnar
tested positive for [clomiphene](/wiki/Clomiphene "Clomiphene" ), a banned
substance on the UFC's anti-doping policy, he was suspended from competing in
the UFC by the Nevada State Athletic Commission for one year, fined $250,000
and his victory over Hunt was overturned to a no-contest. Lesnar then retired
from MMA for a second time in 2017.

Lesnar is a five-time world champion in WWE, a one-time [heavyweight
champion](/wiki/UFC_Heavyweight_Championship "UFC Heavyweight Championship" )

[wrestling](/wiki/Collegiate_wrestling "Collegiate wrestling" ) champion in
the [NCAA](/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Wrestling_Championships "NCAA Division I

in each of those organizations.[16][17] He has headlined numerous [pay-per-

athlete in professional wrestling history".[18]
