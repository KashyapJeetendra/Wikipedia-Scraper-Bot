Mighty Final Fight (マイティ
ファイナルファイト) is a side-scrolling beat-'em-
up released by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment
System
in 1993. It is a
spinoff  of Capcom's
1989 arcade game Final
Fight , which
was previously ported to the Super
NES. Unlike the original game and its SNES ports, the characters in this
edition are depicted in a comical childlike " art style.

The game's plot is a comical re-telling of the story from the first game. Like
the SNES ports, Mighty Final Fight is a single-player game. However, unlike
the SNES versions, it retains all three playable characters from the arcade
version. The game also has various features not seen in a Final Fight game
up to that point, including an experience points system allowing players to earn new fighting maneuvers.

Mighty Final Fight was re-released in the 2006 compilation Capcom Classics Mini-
Mix for the
Game Boy Advance.
