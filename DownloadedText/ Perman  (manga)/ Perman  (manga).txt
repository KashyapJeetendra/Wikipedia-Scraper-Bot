Perman (パーマン, Pāman), by Fujiko
Fujio, is a Japanese manga and anime about a clumsy boy, Mitsuo Suwa,
who is chosen to apprentice to a powerful superhero. Although created as a parody of Superman (the name "Perman" is
based on "Superman" without the "Su', the character's creators appear to have
distanced themselves from this origin story. In the comic-essay "Passionate
Days of Perman" (PARマンの情熱的な日々), Fujiko F. Fujio claims the name is actually a
reference to the "par" concept in golf. In addition, due to copyright
concerns, the name of Mitsuo's boss was later changed from "Superman" to
"Birdman". It is also a comic series in Ninja Hattori; Kenichi really enjoys reading them.

The first series was serialized in Shōnen Sunday and other magazines from 1967 to 1968, and the second was
serialized in CoroCoro Comic from
1983 to 1986. The first anime series was first produced in black and white in
1967. It was remade in color in 1983 and films were released in 1983, 1984,
1985, 2003 and 2004 along with Doraemon films.
