Tekken ( Japanese :
鉄拳  ,  in December 1994, the series has received several sequels
as well as updates and spin-off titles. Tekken was one of the first fighting
games at the time to use 3D animation. The series has also been adapted into
three films and other media. The series' official English name is always
written in all-capital letters (TEKKEN, abbreviated to TK). There are six
main installments to the series, one installment having an updated version
that also made a home release, two non-canonical installments, and a seventh
mainline game in the works.

The premise of each game in the main series documents the events of the King
of Iron Fist Tournament, hosted by the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation. The prize
is typically control of the company, which then allows the winner to host the
following tournament. After beating the game with each character, an ending
 cutscene  is unlocked and usually one of the
endings from each game becomes the continuation of the story into the
following installment. The story has largely revolved around the Mishima clan
curse, which began narratively with  Heihachi Mishima  throwing his son  Kazuya Mishima  from a cliff when he was 5 years old. Kazuya was nearly
killed from the fall, but through the influence of the " Devil
Gene " he survived and swore revenge to his
father by the time of the King of Iron Fist Tournament.

The  second game  and  its sequel  were considered breakthrough titles and among the  greatest games
of all time , the latter also being the second  best selling
fighting game  to date. The series itself is the best selling fighting game
franchise in history.
