# Wikipedia-Scraper-Bot
A wikipedia scraper bot made in python

<b>To do</b>

*  ~~Create a very basic wikipedia scraper that scrapes the title and the first few paragraphs. We will provide a url and the scraped text will be stored in a text file in a output folder.~~


*  ~~Create a separate file for the downloaded text~~

* ~~Divide the code among various modules~~

* ~~Clean the scraped data~~

* Add comments to the code

* ~~Handle the exceptions that could occur~~

* Make a reddit bot out of it


* The Structure will look like=> Main.py, Scraper.py, Cleaner.py,TxtToFile.py, downloadedTxt Folder

The Scraper doesn't work correctly on pages(like Illuminati) that have quotes text in them. Needs to be fixed
